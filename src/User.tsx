I also configured Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus using Ansible playbooks.I utilized Git for version control and stored my source code on GitHub. For packaging the application, I used the Maven build tool. Vulnerability scanning was performed with SonarQube and Trivy, and Nexus was used to store artifacts.Docker was employed to build the application's Docker image, which was then pushed to Docker Hub. Jenkins was used to create a pipeline using Groovy language. The Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, created on AWS in the form of EKS using Terraform, facilitated the deployment.Additionally, I set up monitoring for the application, covering both system-level metrics and website-level metrics.",
